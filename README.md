SpeakSmart – Confidence Quest is a gamified web-based public speaking improvement platform designed to help users build confidence through structured levels and real-time speech analysis. The system uses browser-based speech recognition to convert spoken input into text and evaluates performance metrics such as speech duration, words per minute (WPM), and filler word usage.
The platform introduces progressive levels (Beginner, Intermediate, Confident) where users practice structured speaking tasks and AI-driven interaction scenarios. Performance scoring, XP rewards, badges, and level progression encourage consistent improvement and measurable growth.
